# About

The icosa package implements triangular tessellation to refine regular icosahedra in 3d space - which can be used as horizontal grids, such as this: 

```{R, fig.out=8, fig.width=4}
library(icosa)
gr <- hexagrid(deg=10, sf=TRUE) # create grid
plot(gr)
```

# Tutorials moved to package website 

To make the package as small as possible, the tutorials on how to use the package are available at the package website:
